# Heart-Health

**Heart-Health** is an innovative project designed to empower individuals in assessing their heart health. By leveraging machine learning, it predicts heart disease risk based on specific health parameters. Let's explore its features:

## Features

1. **Heart Disease Prediction**:
   - Users input essential health parameters, including blood pressure, cholesterol levels, age, and family history.
   - Our robust machine learning model processes this data and provides a risk assessment.
   - The prediction informs users about their heart disease risk level (e.g., low, moderate, high).

2. **Summary Report**:
   - After prediction, Heart-Health generates a comprehensive summary report.
   - The report includes:
     - Risk level (e.g., low, moderate, high).
     - Key contributing factors (such as elevated blood pressure or high cholesterol).
     - Personalized recommendations (e.g., exercise routines, dietary adjustments).

3. **Personalized Diet Plan**:
   - Based on the risk assessment and individual parameters, Heart-Health suggests a tailored diet plan.
   - The plan may include foods to avoid, recommended nutrients, and portion sizes.
